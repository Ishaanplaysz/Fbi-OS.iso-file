# FBI-OS Build & Usage Instructions

## 1. Building FBI-OS ISO (Recommended: Linux VM)

1. Install a Linux VM (Ubuntu recommended) using VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V.
2. Clone your repository into the VM:
   git clone https://github.com/Ishaanplaysz/Fbi-OS.iso-file.git
3. Open a terminal in the VM and run:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y debootstrap squashfs-tools xorriso grub-pc-bin grub-efi-amd64-bin mtools git-lfs feh conky-all
4. Run the build script:
   bash fbi-os/scripts/build_iso.sh
5. The ISO file will be created in the build directory.

## 2. Adding/Testing Features
- Edit scripts and configs in the `fbi-os` folder as needed.
- Commit and push changes using Git LFS for large files.

## 3. Update Feature
- FBI-OS includes an update button that runs the `update_os.sh` script.
- This script pulls the latest code and updates the system automatically.

## 4. Troubleshooting
- If you encounter permission or mount errors, ensure you are running in a real Linux VM with root access.
- Codespaces and WSL are not suitable for building bootable ISOs due to system restrictions.

## 5. Need Help?
- Reach out to GitHub Copilot or check the README for more details.
